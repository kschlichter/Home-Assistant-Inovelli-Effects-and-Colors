#   Note that the on/off LZW30-SN switch has 1 fewer effect, which makes its math slightly different than the dimmers or other devices with a full LED bar.
#
# Required for setting the LED indicator
#   LEDcolor: (int or string) Sets color of LED status and must be one of: Off, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Teal, Blue, Purple, Light Pink, Pink, White
#     Note that the Blue 2-in-1 switch/dimmer supports separate colors for on and off; but currently this just sets them both to whatever color is selected
#   LEDbrightness: (whole integer 1 – 10) Sets the brightness of the LED status when on.
#   LEDbrightness_off: (whole integer 1 – 10) Sets the brightness of the LED status when off.
#
# Required for setting LED effects
#   duration: (string or whole integer of seconds) Either "Off", an integer of seconds, or a whole integer followed by "Second", "Seconds", "Minute", or "Minutes", "Hour", "Hours", "Indefinitely", or "Forever".
#   effect: (string) One of: "Off", "Solid", "Chase" (not available on switches), "Fast Blink", "Slow Blink", "Blink", or "Pulse".
#   brightness: (integer 1 – 10) Sets the brightness of the LED's effect
#   color: (string) Sets color of LED effect and must be one of: Off, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Teal, Blue, Purple, Light Pink, Pink, White
